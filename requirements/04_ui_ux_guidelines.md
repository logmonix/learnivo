# UI/UX Guidelines: Kid-Friendly & Engaging

## Design Philosophy
"The interface should look like a playground, not a spreadsheet."

## Color Palette
Avoid standard "Bootstrap" colors. Use a vibrant, custom palette.
- **Primary**: Electric Purple or Ocean Blue (Calm but energetic).
- **Action**: Sunset Orange or Lime Green (For buttons like "Start", "Next").
- **Background**: Soft off-white or warm cream (easier on eyes than stark white).
- **Dark Mode**: Deep Navy (not pure black) for night-time learning.

## Typography
- **Headings**: `Fredoka One` or `Baloo 2` (Rounded, friendly, readable).
- **Body**: `Nunito` or `Quicksand` (Rounded sans-serif, high legibility).
- **Size**: Base font size should be larger (18px+) for readability.

## Interface Elements

### The "Card" Metaphor
Everything is a card.
- **Lesson Card**: Big image, progress bar, "Play" button.
- **Profile Card**: Avatar prominently displayed.

### Feedback & Micro-animations
- **Correct Answer**: Confetti explosion, happy sound, card glows green.
- **Wrong Answer**: Gentle shake animation, supportive message ("Try again!"), card glows orange (never harsh red).
- **Loading**: Animated characters juggling or reading, not a boring spinner.

### Navigation
- **Bottom Bar** (Mobile style) even on Desktop:
    - Home (Dashboard)
    - Learn (Curriculum)
    - Practice (Daily Mix)
    - Profile (Stats & Avatar)
- **Big Buttons**: Fitts's Law - make clickable areas large and obvious.

## Accessibility
- **Contrast**: High contrast for text.
- **Icons + Text**: Never rely on icons alone. Always label buttons.
- **Voice Support**: Microphone button visible in input fields.
